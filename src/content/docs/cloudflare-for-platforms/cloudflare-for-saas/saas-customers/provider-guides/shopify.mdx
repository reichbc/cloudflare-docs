## Benefits

O2O routing also enables you to take advantage of Cloudflare zones specifically customized for Shopify traffic.

## How it works

For more details about how O2O is different than other Cloudflare setups, refer to [How O2O works](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/saas-customers/how-it-works/).

## Enable

An Enterprise zone plan is required for O2O to a Shopify origin.

:::note  
Setting up your zone with O2O with a Shopify origin currently requires a Support Case due to a provider limitation in the Cloudflare for SaaS platform.  
We are working to improve this experience. Please submit a Support Case to request O2O enablement for your zone.  
:::  

Once enabled by Support, set up O2O on your zone by [creating a `CNAME` DNS record.](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/#create-dns-records)

| Type    | Name                 | Target                | Proxy status |
| ------- | -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------ |
| `CNAME` | `<YOUR_SHOP_DOMAIN>` | `shops.myshopify.com` | Proxied      |

Be sure that you are using `shops.myshopify.com`. Using your store-specific url (for example `trinketstore.myshopify.com`) will not work; it is not the Shopify SaaS domain.

:::note  
For questions about Shopify setup, refer to their [support guide](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/domains/add-a-domain/connecting-domains/connect-domain-manual).  
If you cannot activate your domain using [proxied DNS records](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/), reach out to your account team or the [Cloudflare Community](https://community.cloudflare.com).

### DNS CAA records

Shopify issues SSL/TLS certificates for merchant domains using Let’s Encrypt. If you add any DNS CAA records, you must select Let’s Encrypt as the Certificate Authority (CA) or HTTPS connections may fail.

For more details, refer to [CAA records](/ssl/edge-certificates/caa-records/#caa-records-added-by-cloudflare).
